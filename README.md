##Setting Up a Java Selenium Environment

<p>These procedures will show you to set up a Selenium environment for Java. You first install the Java JDK and and then IntelliJ IDEA. You’ll then create a simple program to check that the Java environment is correct. Next, you’ll  set up the Selenium environment and testing framework for running your tests remotely on Sauce Labs. Finally, you will run a test that we provide to make sure your Selenium environment is correctly configured</p>
